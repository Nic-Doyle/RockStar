Meeting on the 18th, January, 2013.

Game design was confirmed.  We have decided to go with the Space themed game.  The player will control the mass of planets,
the initial speed of the projectile.  We may have collection items throughout the world.  The player will launch a probe 
at a planet. The next level the player starts at the target planet of the last level. 
As always, any questions can be directed to either Alex, or myself.
